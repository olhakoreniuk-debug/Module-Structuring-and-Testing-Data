// Predict and explain first...

// Predict the output of the following code:
// =============> Write your prediction here
//The function declared the constant 103, so each time it will execute last digit of 103 which is 3.
 

function getLastDigit(num) {
  return num.toString().slice(-1);
}

console.log(`The last digit of 42 is ${getLastDigit(42)}`);
console.log(`The last digit of 105 is ${getLastDigit(105)}`);
console.log(`The last digit of 806 is ${getLastDigit(806)}`);

// Now run the code and compare the output to your prediction
// =============> write the output here
//The last digit of 42 is 3
//The last digit of 105 is 3
//The last digit of 806 is 3

//Explain why the output is the way it is
// =============> write your explanation here
// The function getLastDigit is not working properly because it always returns the last digit of the number 103, which is 3, instead of the last digit of the input number.
// Finally, correct the code to fix the problem
// =============> write your new code here

// This program should tell the user the last digit of each number.
// Explain why getLastDigit is not working properly - correct the problem
